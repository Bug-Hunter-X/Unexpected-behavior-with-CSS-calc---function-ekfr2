The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be unexpected behavior if spaces are not correctly handled within the `calc()` function. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, while `width: calc( 100% - 10px );` might lead to unexpected results due to extra spaces.  Another potential issue is incorrect operator usage or unit mixing within `calc()` which could result in unexpected or invalid values. For example, mixing percentages and pixels without proper calculation can cause issues.
